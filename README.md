# MyApp Deployment with Cyclops: A Beginner's Guide

## Overview

Welcome to this beginner-friendly guide on deploying your application using Cyclops and Kubernetes. This guide will walk you through the basic steps needed to get your app up and running.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Docker**: A tool for creating and managing containers.
- **Kubernetes**: A system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. You can use Minikube for local development or connect to any Kubernetes cluster.
- **Helm** (optional): A package manager for Kubernetes that simplifies deployment and management of applications. You can skip this step if you're not using Helm.

### Build and Push Docker Image

1. **Build the Docker Image**

   First, you need to create a Docker image of your application. Open your terminal and run:
   ```bash
   docker build -t myapp:latest .
   ```
   This command will create an image tagged `myapp:latest` from the Dockerfile in your project directory.

2. **Push the Image to Docker Hub**

   Next, upload your Docker image to Docker Hub (a cloud-based Docker registry). Replace `<your-dockerhub-username>` with your actual Docker Hub username:
   ```bash
   docker tag myapp:latest <your-dockerhub-username>/myapp:latest
   docker push <your-dockerhub-username>/myapp:latest
   ```

### Deploying to Kubernetes

1. **Apply the Deployment Configuration**

   Use Kubernetes to deploy your application. First, apply the deployment configuration file with:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
   ```
   This command will create the necessary resources in your Kubernetes cluster based on the configuration defined in `deployment.yaml`.

2. **Apply the Service Configuration**

   Next, expose your application with a service:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f service.yaml
   ```
   This will create a service that makes your application accessible.

### Using Helm (Optional)

1. **Install Helm**

   If you prefer to use Helm for managing Kubernetes applications, follow the installation instructions from [Helm's official site](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).

2. **Deploy Using Helm**

   Deploy your application with Helm by running:
   ```bash
   helm install myapp ./charts/myapp
   ```
   This command will use the Helm chart located in `./charts/myapp` to deploy your application.

### Access the Application

To see your application in action, use port-forwarding to access it from your local machine:
```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/myapp-service 8881:80
```
Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8881](http://localhost:8881) to view the application.
